## gpg
all commits are signed with gpg. my key fingerprint is `07F988C86662F3821CEC1E39BFB779869FEE99D2` (sometimes commits may be signed through github's website, although rarely). you can get my key [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/07F988C86662F3821CEC1E39BFB779869FEE99D2). vigilant mode is enabled, so you can check whether my commits are signed or not in the commit history. i sign every commit as of november 2021.
